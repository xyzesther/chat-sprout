2. **Notebook Functionality**

   - Developed the `NotebookScreen` where users can view, add, search, and delete notes, notes are sorted by timestamp.
   - Integrated Firebase to fetch notes data in real-time, ensuring that any `CRUD operations` are instantly reflected on the screen.
   - Integrated `SearchBar` with real-time filtering by title or content for quick access to specific notes.

3. **Rich Text Editor / Add Note Screen**

   - Created a custom `RichTextEditor` component to allow users to add rich content to their notes, including text and images.
   - Integrated `expo-image-picker` to allow users to insert images from their deviceâ€™s gallery into notes.
   - Configured image handling, including deletion functionality, so users can remove images if needed.

4. **Save Conversations to Notebook**
   - Implemented the function that allows users to add conversations directly from the conversation screen to their notebook.

**Mingyi Li:**

- **Learn Tab**

  - Display Themes and Topics

    - Users can explore conversation topics through an `interactive map interface`, adding a `gamified` experience.
      Each theme is visually represented with distinct sections on the map.
    - Clicking on a specific topic `navigates` users to a detailed conversation view.

  - Display Conversations

    - The conversation examples are shown using a `conversation card`, making it easy to browse different dialogues.
    - Each card contains two `conversation bubbles`, presenting the dialogue in a `chat format`. The bubbles alternate direction and color to visually differentiate the sender and receiver, creating a realistic conversation flow. Users can click the play icon on the bubble to listen to the `audio` clip, practicing pronunciation and improving their listening skills.

- **Account Tab**

  - Profile
    - `Displays` user information such as email, name, and password.
    - Users can easily `edit` their profile details using sliding-up sheet.
  - Setting
    - Provides a daily `notification` feature to remind users to practice their conversations.
    - Users can enable or disable the notification with a switch and customize the reminder time using a time picker, ensuring flexibility based on their schedule.
